## Changes from 1.3.0
In this release, we added a dedicated settings page, as well as changing the way locomotives and function maps are added. Also, we have switched to a new distribution method, PWAs! Oh, did we mention the new and improved wider UI? Overall, we would be better off listing the sections that have stayed the same!

__New Features:__
* Side menu - We have added a side menu to switch between 'pages'
* Locomotive page - This is where locomotives are now added
* Functions page - This is where function maps are now created
* Settings page - This page contains all the options to manage storage settings and to choose different themes and throttles
* Emergency stop button - There is now a button to provide the emergency stop feature
* Information and help button - These have been added to the top right of the screen and display the version, along with other information

__Fixes:__
* The button to minimise the top section is displayed correctly

__Changed behaviour:__
* Locomotives now need to be added in the locomotives menu before they are used
* The UI is now wider
* Other minor tweaks to the UI
